Template UI Editor was built to eliminate the tiresome work switching to and from code and browser while we edit an HTML page. To get started, simply copy *uiedit.php* and */ckeditor* folder to the root where your html files reside on your server. After copying mentioned files just visit http://localhost/uiedit.php or www.yoursite.com/path/to/dir/uiedit.php

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

In order to use editor, you just need to have 
* PHP
* HTML files you want to edit


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Grab *uiedit.php* and */ckeditor* and paste these two file and folder respectively in a folder containing your html files which you intend to edit. The files which you intend to edit must be present on a PHP-configured server so that Template UI Editor can work properly. 


## Deployment

It is advised that you edit the files and then remove *uiedit.php* and */ckeditor* while deploying the site.
